[![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/jlesage/dupeguru.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jlesage/dupeguru/) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/jlesage/dupeguru.svg)](http://microbadger.com/#/images/jlesage/dupeguru "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com") [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jlesage/docker-dupeguru.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jlesage/docker-dupeguru)

This is a Docker container for dupeGuru.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on client side) or via any VNC client.

dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It can scan either
filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm
that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same.

---

## Quick Start

Launch the dupeGuru docker container with the following command:
```
docker run -d --rm \
    --name=dupeguru \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -p 5900:5900 \
    -v /docker/appdata/dupeguru:/config:rw \
    -v $HOME:/storage:rw \
    jlesage/dupeguru
```

Where:
  - `/docker/appdata/dupeguru`: This is where the application stores its configuration, log and any files needing persistency.
  - `$HOME`: This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible by the application.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the dupeGuru GUI.  Files from
the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.

## Usage

```
docker run [-d] [--rm] \
    --name=dupeguru \
    [-e <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>]... \
    [-v <HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]]... \
    [-p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>]... \
    jlesage/dupeguru
```
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| -d        | Run the container in background.  If not set, the container runs in foreground. |
| --rm      | Automatically remove the container when it exits. |
| -e        | Pass an environment variable to the container.  See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for more details. |
| -v        | Set a volume mapping (allows to share a folder/file between the host and the container).  See the [Data Volumes](#data-volumes) section for more details. |
| -p        | Set a network port mapping (exposes an internal container port to the host).  See the [Ports](#ports) section for more details. |

### Environment Variables

To customize some properties of the container, the following environment
variables can be passed via the `-e` parameter (one for each variable).  Value
of this parameter has the format `<VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>`.

| Variable       | Description                                  | Default |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
|`USER_ID`| ID of the user the application runs as.  See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) to better understand when this should be set. | `1000` |
|`GROUP_ID`| ID of the group the application runs as.  See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) to better understand when this should be set. | `1000` |
|`SUP_GROUP_IDS`| Comma-separated list of supplementary group IDs of the application. | (unset) |
|`UMASK`| Mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created files. The value of the mask is in octal notation.  By default, this variable is not set and the default umask of `022` is used, meaning that newly created files are readable by everyone, but only writable by the owner. See the following online umask calculator: http://wintelguy.com/umask-calc.pl | (unset) |
|`TZ`| [TimeZone] of the container.  Timezone can also be set by mapping `/etc/localtime` between the host and the container. | `Etc/UTC` |
|`KEEP_APP_RUNNING`| When set to `1`, the application will be automatically restarted if it crashes or if user quits it. | `0` |
|`APP_NICENESS`| Priority at which the application should run.  A niceness value of -20 is the highest priority and 19 is the lowest priority.  By default, niceness is not set, meaning that the default niceness of 0 is used.  **NOTE**: A negative niceness (priority increase) requires additional permissions.  In this case, the container should be run with the docker option `--cap-add=SYS_NICE`. | (unset) |
|`CLEAN_TMP_DIR`| When set to `1`, all files in the `/tmp` directory are delete during the container startup. | `1` |
|`DISPLAY_WIDTH`| Width (in pixels) of the application's window. | `1280` |
|`DISPLAY_HEIGHT`| Height (in pixels) of the application's window. | `768` |
|`VNC_PASSWORD`| Password needed to connect to the application's GUI.  See the [VNC Pasword](#vnc-password) section for more details. | (unset) |
|`X11VNC_EXTRA_OPTS`| Extra options to pass to the x11vnc server running in the Docker container.  **WARNING**: For advanced users. Do not use unless you know what you are doing. | (unset) |

### Data Volumes

The following table describes data volumes used by the container.  The mappings
are set via the `-v` parameter.  Each mapping is specified with the following
format: `<HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]`.

| Container path  | Permissions | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
|`/config`| rw | This is where the application stores its configuration, log and any files needing persistency. |
|`/storage`| rw | This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible by the application. |
|`/trash`| rw | This is where duplicated files are moved when they are sent to trash. |

### Ports

Here is the list of ports used by the container.  They can be mapped to the host
via the `-p` parameter (one per port mapping).  Each mapping is defined in the
following format: `<HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>`.  The port number inside the
container cannot be changed, but you are free to use any port on the host side.

| Port | Mapping to host | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| 5800 | Mandatory | Port used to access the application's GUI via the web interface. |
| 5900 | Mandatory | Port used to access the application's GUI via the VNC protocol. |

## User/Group IDs

When using data volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can occur between the
host and the container.  For example, the user within the container may not
exists on the host.  This could prevent the host from properly accessing files
and folders on the shared volume.

To avoid any problem, you can specify the user the application should run as.

This is done by passing the user ID and group ID to the container via the
`USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment variables.

To find the right IDs to use, issue the following command on the host, with the
user owning the data volume on the host:

    id <username>

Which gives an output like this one:
```
uid=1000(myuser) gid=1000(myuser) groups=1000(myuser),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin)
```

The value of `uid` (user ID) and `gid` (group ID) are the ones that you should
be given the container.

## Accessing the GUI

Assuming the host is mapped to the same ports as the container, the graphical
interface of the application can be accessed via:

  * A web browser:
```
http://<HOST IP ADDR>:5800
```

  * Any VNC client:
```
<HOST IP ADDR>:5900
```

If different ports are mapped to the host, make sure they respect the
following formula:

    VNC_PORT = HTTP_PORT + 100

This is to make sure accessing the GUI with a web browser can be done without
specifying the VNC port manually.  If this is not possible, then specify
explicitly the VNC port like this:

    http://<HOST IP ADDR>:5800/?port=<VNC PORT>

## VNC Password

To restrict access to your application, a password can be specified.  This can
be done via two methods:
  * By using the `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  * By creating a `.vncpass_clear` file at the root of the `/config` volume.
  This file should contains the password (in clear).  During the container
  startup, content of the file is obfuscated and renamed to `.vncpass`.

**NOTE**: This is a very basic way to restrict access to the application and it
should not be considered as secure in any way.

## dupeGuru Deletion Options

When deleting duplicated files, dupeGuru offer two choices:
  * Send files to trash
  * Delete files directly

The first option moves files to the `/trash` directory inside the container.
This operation can be slow for large files since it may imply a copy of the
data before the actual deletion.

There is also an option to link deleted files.  It is not recommended to enable
this option, since there is a good chance that created links won't make sense
outside the container.
